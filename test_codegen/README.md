This crate is associated with the integrations tests. **You should not run it stand-alone** - use the dedicated `integration` crate instead.

This crate is a scaffold containing a schema and queries stress-testing as many features as possible. The generated code is kept alongside to monitor breaking changes and to prevent unintentional changes to our generated interfaces.
